// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

input number
check if number is /2 
if number is divisible by 2
print even
else
print odd


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
input number1
input number2
input number3
input number4
input number5

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
number1+input number2+input number3+input number4+input number5 / 5




c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

number1 < number2
number 2 < number3
number 3 < number 4
number 4 < number 5

output the smallest and the max


d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

the average is input
the min is â€¦. the max is â€¦.
